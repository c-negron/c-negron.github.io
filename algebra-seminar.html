    <td>Diameter bounds for finite classical groups generated by transvections<br><br>
    Abstract: The diameter of a group G with respect to a symmetric generating set X is the smallest integer d such that every element of G is the product of at most d elements of X. A well-known conjecture of Babai predicts that every nonabelian finite simple group G has diameter (log |G|)^O(1) with respect to any generating set. This is known to be true for bounded-rank groups of Lie type (Helfgott; Pyber--Szabo; Breuillard--Green--Tao), but the conjecture is wide open for high-rank groups. There has bee a good deal of progress recently for generating sets containing either special elements or random elements. In this talk I will outline the proof that the conjecture holds for the classical groups SL_n(q), Sp_{2n}(q), SU_n(q) and any generating set containing a transvection. The proof is based essentially on (a) the positive resolution of Babai's conjecture in bounded rank and (b) a result of Kantor classifying finite irreducible linear groups generated by transvections.</td>

    <td>Reducibility criterion for the Cohen-Wales representation of the Artin group of type E6<br><br>
    Abstract: We introduce tangles of type En and relations on these tangles. We use this novel diagrammatic algebra to build a representation of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of type E6. As a representation of the Artin group of type E6, this representation is equivalent to the faithful representation of Cohen and Wales introduced by them in 2000 as a generalization to the Artin groups of the faithful Lawrence-Krammer representation of the braid group. The latter representation became famous as it is the only representation of the braid group that is known to be faithful. We use our newly built representation to find a reducibility criterion for the Cohen-Wales representation of the Artin group of type E6. Our method generalizes to types E7 and E8. 
This talk is given to honor the memory of my late Ph.D. advisor David Wales (1939-2023).</td>
