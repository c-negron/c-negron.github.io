    <td>Diameter bounds for finite classical groups generated by transvections<br><br>
    Abstract: The diameter of a group G with respect to a symmetric generating set X is the smallest integer d such that every element of G is the product of at most d elements of X. A well-known conjecture of Babai predicts that every nonabelian finite simple group G has diameter (log |G|)^O(1) with respect to any generating set. This is known to be true for bounded-rank groups of Lie type (Helfgott; Pyber--Szabo; Breuillard--Green--Tao), but the conjecture is wide open for high-rank groups. There has bee a good deal of progress recently for generating sets containing either special elements or random elements. In this talk I will outline the proof that the conjecture holds for the classical groups SL_n(q), Sp_{2n}(q), SU_n(q) and any generating set containing a transvection. The proof is based essentially on (a) the positive resolution of Babai's conjecture in bounded rank and (b) a result of Kantor classifying finite irreducible linear groups generated by transvections.</td>

    <td>Reducibility criterion for the Cohen-Wales representation of the Artin group of type E6<br><br>
    Abstract: We introduce tangles of type En and relations on these tangles. We use this novel diagrammatic algebra to build a representation of the Birman-Murakami-Wenzl algebra of type E6. As a representation of the Artin group of type E6, this representation is equivalent to the faithful representation of Cohen and Wales introduced by them in 2000 as a generalization to the Artin groups of the faithful Lawrence-Krammer representation of the braid group. The latter representation became famous as it is the only representation of the braid group that is known to be faithful. We use our newly built representation to find a reducibility criterion for the Cohen-Wales representation of the Artin group of type E6. Our method generalizes to types E7 and E8. 
This talk is given to honor the memory of my late Ph.D. advisor David Wales (1939-2023).</td>

    <td>Okounkov's conjecture via BPS Lie algebras<br><br>
    Abstract: Given an arbitrary finite quiver Q, Maulik and Okounkov defined a new Yangian-style quantum group.  It is built from the FRT formalism and their construction of R matrices on the cohomology of Nakajima quiver varieties, via the stable envelopes that they also defined.  Just as in the case of ordinary Yangians, there is a Lie algebra g_Q inside their new algebra, and the Yangian is a deformation of the current algebra of this Lie algebra.<br>
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of extended ADE type, numerous basic features of g_Q have remained mysterious since the outset of the subject, for example, the dimensions of the graded pieces.  A conjecture of Okounkov predicts that these dimensions are given by the coefficients of Kac's polynomials, which count isomorphism classes of absolutely indecomposable Q-representations over finite fields.  I will explain a recent proof, with Botta, of this conjecture.  By proving that the Maulik-Okounkov Lie algebra g_Q is isomorphic to certain BPS Lie algebras, we prove Okounkov's conjecture, as well as essentially determining the isomorphism class of g_Q, thanks to recent joint work of myself with Hennecart and Schlegel Mejia.</td>

    <td>Some properties and computations of cellular A^1-homology of smooth
projective rational k-schemes<br><br>
Abstract: In this talk I will discuss some computations related to the study
A^1-connected smooth projective schemes X over a fixed field k (mostly
perfect).<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a smooth projective k-scheme, A^1-connected means A^1-chain
connected, and rational smooth projective k-schemes are A^1-connected on
nice field (char 0 for instance) as we observed some time ago with A. Asok.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After briefly introducing the cellular A^1-homology sheaves (with Anand
Sawant) I will explain why these are good for, for instance by
understanding the top dimensional one. I will explain some of the basic
facts and difficulties involved concerning strictly A^1-invariant
sheaves, and give some examples and computations of those.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular I will explain the case of smooth projective rational
surfaces, where Poincare' duality holds (over a perfect field).

    <td>Cycle index methods in algebra and number theory<br><br>
    Abstract: It has been said that most mathematicians have just a few tricks. In this talk, I reveal my favorite trick: cycle index generating functions. We discuss this for the symmetric group and for finite groups of Lie type. We point out connections with algebra and number theory.</td>
