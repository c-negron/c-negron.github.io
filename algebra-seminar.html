    <td>Integral motives on affine flag varieties<br><br>
    Abstract: A result of Bezrukavnikov gives two categorical incarnations of the affine Hecke algebra, and can be viewed as a geometric Langlands correspondence in the tamely ramified case. I will discuss progress toward an enhancement of this result to mixed sheaves with integral coefficients. This includes motivic versions of the geometric Satake equivalence and Gaitsgory's central functor, which categorify the center of the affine Hecke algebra. This is joint work with T. van den Hove and J. Scholbach.</td>

    <td>Trace of the affine Hecke category<br><br>
    Abstract: The affine Hecke category, defined using affine Soergel bimodules,
categorifies the affine Hecke algebra. I will compare the derived
horizontal trace of the affine Hecke category with the elliptic Hall
algebra, and with the derived category of the commuting stack. In
particular, I will describe certain explicit generators for the trace
category and some categorical commutation relations between these. This
is a joint work with Andrei Negut.</td>

  <td>Hecke and Artin monoids and their homomorphisms<br><br>
Abstract: In the present talk we discuss relations between various types of homomorphisms between Hecke and Artin monoids. Our original motivation was based on a striking observation that parabolic projections of Hecke monoids preserve parabolic elements which appeared naturally in the framework of actions of cacti on geometric crystals. We will present several new infinite families of homomorphisms which in some cases provide a complete classification.</td>

    <td>Algebraic Independence of Special Points on Shimura Varieties<br><br>
    Abstract: The subject of special subvarieties in Shimura varieties has been of longstanding interest in algebraic geometry and number theory – major questions include the Zilber--Pink Conjecture and the consequential Andr&#233;--Oort Conjecture, which was recently proved by Pila, Tsimerman and Shankar.  In this talk, I will introduce new results and applications in the direction of unlikely intersections in the recent joint paper with Roy Zhao. Especially, given some correspondence <i>V</i> between a connected Shimura variety <i>S</i> and a commutative connected algebraic group <i>G</i>, and a positive integer <i>n</i>, we prove that the <i>V</i>-images of any <i>n</i> special points on <i>S</i> outside a proper Zariski closed subset are algebraically independent. Our result unifies previous unlikely intersection results on multiplicative independence and linear independence.  We also give an application to abelian varieties by proving that the special points of <i>S</i> whose <i>V</i>-images lie in a finite-rank subgroup of <i>G</i> are contained in a finite union of proper special subvarieties of <i>S</i>, only dependent on the rank of the subgroup. In this way, our result is a generalization of the works of Pila--Tsimerman and Buium--Poonen. Also, I will talk about our results on multiplicative independence of differences of singular moduli, generalizing previous results by Pila--Tsimerman, and Aslanyan--Eterovic--Fowler.</td>

    <td>Representations of general linear groups in the Verlinde category<br><br>
    Abstract: The Verlinde category Ver<sub>p</sub> is the semisimplification of the category of finite-dimensional representations of Z/pZ in characteristic p. In <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02372">arXiv:2107.02372</a> Coulembier, Etingof, and Ostrik showed that all pre-Tannakian categories of moderate growth with additional nice property (Frobenius exactness) admit a fiber functor into Ver<sub>p</sub>. Consequently, the study of representations of affine group schemes in such categories reduces to studying representations of affine group schemes in Ver<sub>p</sub>.<br><br>

I will talk about what is known about the category of representations of the affine group scheme GL(X) for an object X in Ver<sub>p</sub>, and about the highest weight structure on it.

    <td>Classical representation theory via categorification<br><br>
The standard approach to representation theory in categories like Rep(G) for a reductive group over an algebraically closed field, or the BGG category O attached to a semisimple Lie algebra, is based on the combinatorics of the underlying Weyl group (and its Hecke algebra). In Cartan type A, there is another approach exploiting combinatorics of an underlying Kac-Moody algebra (or its quantized enveloping algebra). This was developed in examples over many decades, and fits into a unified general framework which we now call "Heisenberg categorification". I will explain the general setup and some of its consequences. Analogous approaches are slowly emerging for the other families OSp, P and Q of classical supergroups, and I will say a bit more about the type Q case which is the next most complete.</td>

    <td>Levin-Wen is a Gauge Theory<br><br>
In this talk we will examine a class of SPT's protected by the tube algebra of a unitary fusion category <em>C</em> and show that gauging this symmetry produces the standard Levin-Wen model associated to C. Mathematically, the main tool we introduce to accomplish this goal are the spine coral skein modules which corresponds graphically to the Day convolution products of tube algebra representations. This talk is based off of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13838">arXiv:2401.13838</a>, joint with Kyle Kawagoe, Corey Jones, Sean Sanford, and David Penneys.</td>
