    <td>Canonical Bases for Coulomb Branches
    <br><br>
    Abstract: Following work of Kapustin-Saulina and Gaiotto-Moore-Neitzke, one expects half-BPS line defects in certain supersymmetric 4d quantum field theories to form monoidal categories with rich structures (for example, a monoidal cluster structure in many cases). This talk explains an algebro-geometric approach to defining this category in the case of gauge theories with polarizable matter. This definition takes the form of a nonstandard t-structure on the dg category of coherent sheaves on the derived Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima space of triples. We refer to objects in this category as Koszul-perverse coherent sheaves, as this t-structure interpolates between the perverse coherent t-structure and certain t-structures appearing in the theory of Koszul duality (specializing to these in the case of a pure gauge theory and an abelian gauge theory, respectively). As a byproduct, this defines a canonical basis in the associated quantized Coulomb branch by passing to classes of irreducible objects. This is joint work with Sabin Cautis.</td>

    <td>Coregularity of Fano varieties
    <br><br>
    Abstract: Fano varieties are one of the three important blocks of algebraic varieties. In this talk we will review the history of Fano varieties 
Then, we will discuss some recent invariant, called the coregularity of the Fano variety that measures certain combinatorial complexity of the variety. We will explain how this invariant reflects in the geometry of the Fano variety and how it can help for the classification of such varieties.</td>

    <td>Hilbert's irreducibility theorem via random walks
    <br><br>
    Abstract: Let G be a linear algebraic group over a number field <b>K</b> (e.g., SL<sub>n</sub>), and let f: V &rarr; G be a cover of finite degree. Perform a long random walk on a Cayley graph of a fixed finitely generated subgroup of G(<b>K</b>) (e.g., SL<sub>n</sub>(<b>Z</b>)). Should you expect to hit elements g whose fibre f<sup>-1</sup>(g) is <b>K</b>-irreducible?<br><br>
After giving motivation, we will see that the answer is Yes, under some conditions on G and f. This represents a quantitative version of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem for linear algebraic groups. Joint work with Lior Bary-Soroker.

    <td>Demazure operators for G(m,m,n) and quantum geometric Satake at a root of unity
    <br><br>
    Abstract: The reflection representation of the affine Weyl group in type A admits a q-deformation, which plays a role in quantum geometric Satake. Specializing q to a primitive 2m-th root of unity, one obtains a reflection representation of the complex reflection group G(m,m,n). In this way, a category of "singular Soergel bimodules" for G(m,m,n) is related to representations of quantum groups at roots of unity. To properly study these bimodules, additional algebraic background is needed.<br><br>

Associated to a reflection representation one has an action of a reflection group W on a polynomial ring R. A classic result of Demazure for Coxeter groups states that the inclusion of invariant polynomials into all polynomials is a Frobenius extension. A key tool in Demazure's proof is the nilCoxeter algebra, which acts on R by certain operators now called Demazure operators. Demazure proves that the Frobenius trace agrees with the Demazure operator associated to the longest element. These facts are what make the theory of Soergel bimodules tick.<br><br>

In joint work with Juteau and Young, we study the affine reflection representation of G(m,m,n). We prove the corresponding Frobenius extension result. We investigate an exotic nilCoxeter algebra with Demazure operators associated to elements of the affine Weyl group, acting on the ring R. When n=3, we determine which elements of the affine Weyl group are "longest elements" for G(m,m,n).</td>
