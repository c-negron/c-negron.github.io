<p>Our Simons Collaboration, New Structures in Low-Dimensional Toplogy, aims to bring together researchers across a wide array of disciplins to work on deep problems in low-dimensional topology. Our PIs, postdocs, graduate students, friends and colleagues specialize in topics which range from gauge theory, quantum topology, categorification, 4-manifolds, and even mathematical physics, all intersecting at the juncture of low-dimensional topology.<br><br>

This workshop aims to introduce graduate students and postdocs to some of the foundational topics which are at the center of collaboration. We will have a number of lecture series by junior faculty which are meant, specifically, to bride the gaps between the varied areas which are represented in the collaboration. This workshop also aims to provide young researchers with an opportunity to develop new mathematical connections, or return to pre-existing ones, in the hopes of sparking new and long-lasting collaborations in low-dimensional topology.</p>
